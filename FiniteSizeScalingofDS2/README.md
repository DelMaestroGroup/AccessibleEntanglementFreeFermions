Scaling of the difference between the \ren and operational entanglement entropy, $\Delta S_{2}$ and $H_{2}$, with the log of the variance of $P_n$, $\ln(\sigma^2)$, for subregions up to $\ell=10^5$ connected sites.  The results were calculated using the correlation matrix method for free fermions in the ground state of $\mathcal{H}$.  Inset: Scaling of $\sigma^2$ with $\ln(\ell_c)$, where $\ell_c=(2N/\pi)\sin[\pi\ell/(2N)]$ is the chord length, highlighting the double logarithmic growth of the width of the distribution $P_n$.
